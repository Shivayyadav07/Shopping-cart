ShoppingCartApp

A GUI-based shopping cart application built in Java using Swing. This application allows users to sign up, log in, browse products across categories (Electronics, Books, Clothing, Perfumes), add items to a cart, and complete a checkout process with a delivery address. User data is stored in a users.txt file, and product data is hardcoded in the application.

Features





User Authentication: Sign up, log in, and reset password (simulated email reset).



Product Browsing: View products in categories with a tabbed interface.



Cart Management: Add products to the cart, remove items, and view the total with a discount (10% for orders over ₹5000).



Checkout: Select or enter a delivery address and confirm the order.



File-Based Storage: User data (username, password, email, address) is stored in users.txt.
